# Research Buddy
## Description
Research Buddy is an AI-powered research assistant designed to streamline the process of navigating and extracting insights from academic and technical documents. It leverages state-of-the-art language models and semantic search to provide intelligent responses to user queries based solely on the content of uploaded research materials.

## Objective
The primary objective of Research Buddy is to assist students, researchers, and professionals by automating the understanding and retrieval of relevant information from large sets of PDF-based research documents using natural language queries.

## Introduction
Reading through volumes of research documents can be time-consuming and overwhelming. Research Buddy offers a solution by integrating:

* Document ingestion and text chunking

* Semantic embedding for efficient document search

* Advanced question answering using LLMs

By combining these techniques, users can ask complex questions and receive contextually accurate answers drawn directly from their uploaded research materials.

## Features

- Uploads and processes multiple PDFs from a designated directory

- Uses FAISS for fast vector-based document retrieval

- Supports Llama 3 (via Groq) for high-performance, low-latency responses

- Uses HuggingFace embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic understanding

- Displays answer along with source document excerpts for transparency

- Easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit

## Conclusion
Research Buddy simplifies the task of literature review and research navigation by converting dense documents into an interactive Q&A system. It is an ideal companion for academic researchers, data scientists, and professionals working with large volumes of written content.
